# 🔐 Implement OTP-Based Password Reset System & Fix Routing Issues

## 📋 Summary
This PR implements a comprehensive 3-step OTP-based password reset system and fixes critical routing issues that were redirecting users to the registration page after login.

## 🚀 Features Added

### 1. **Complete Password Reset Flow**
- **Step 1:** Email entry with validation
- **Step 2:** OTP verification with 6-digit code input
- **Step 3:** Password reset with auto-login functionality

### 2. **Enhanced User Experience**
- Visual progress indicators showing current step
- Real-time countdown timer for OTP expiry (2 minutes)
- Smart OTP input (digits only, auto-limit to 6 characters)
- Resend OTP functionality with cooldown
- Responsive design with modern UI

### 3. **Robust Error Handling**
- Comprehensive validation for email, OTP, and password
- Graceful fallback to legacy email link system
- Detailed error messages for different scenarios
- Auto-retry mechanisms for better reliability

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Critical Routing Issue**
- **Problem:** Users were redirected to `/register` instead of dashboard after login
- **Solution:** Fixed catch-all route in `src/App.jsx` to redirect to `/login`
- **Impact:** Proper user flow after authentication

### 2. **AuthContext Import Issues**
- **Problem:** `AuthContext..jsx` file had double dots causing import failures
- **Solution:** Renamed to `AuthContext.jsx` and updated all import statements
- **Impact:** Resolved authentication context errors across components

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **API Integration**
- Integrated with 3 backend endpoints:
  - `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Send OTP
  - `POST /api/auth/verify-otp` - Verify OTP
  - `POST /api/auth/reset-password-with-otp` - Reset password & auto-login

### **Data Type Handling**
- OTP sent as JavaScript Number (not string) for backend compatibility
- Email normalization (lowercase, trimmed)
- Proper form validation and sanitization

### **State Management**
- Multi-step form state management
- Countdown timer with useEffect
- Loading states and error handling
- Fallback system for backward compatibility

## 📱 UI/UX Improvements

### **Modern Design**
- Dark theme with gradient backgrounds
- Animated progress indicators
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes
- Consistent styling with existing design system

### **User Feedback**
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Real-time validation feedback
- Clear error messages and instructions
- Visual confirmation of successful steps

## 🔒 Security Features

### **Input Validation**
- Email format validation with regex
- OTP format validation (6 digits only)
- Password strength requirements (minimum 6 characters)
- Password confirmation matching

### **Auto-Login Security**
- JWT token handling after password reset
- Role-based redirection (admin vs user)
- Secure token storage in localStorage
- Automatic session establishment

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### **Form Validation**
- Email format validation
- OTP length and format validation
- Password strength and confirmation matching
- Real-time feedback for all inputs

### **Error Scenarios**
- Invalid/expired OTP handling
- Network error handling
- Backend validation error display
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## 📂 Files Modified

### **Core Components**
- `src/App.jsx` - Fixed routing configuration
- `src/Components/ForgotPassword.jsx` - Complete rewrite with 3-step flow
- `src/Context/AuthContext.jsx` - Fixed file naming and imports

### **Updated Imports**
- Updated all components importing AuthContext
- Fixed import paths across the application

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

### **Fallback System**
- Automatic detection of OTP vs email link system
- Graceful fallback to legacy system if OTP endpoints unavailable
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### **Progressive Enhancement**
- Works with both old and new backend implementations
- Automatic system detection based on API responses
- Seamless user experience regardless of backend version

## 🎯 User Flow

1. **User enters email** → System sends OTP
2. **User enters OTP** → System verifies code
3. **User sets new password** → System resets password and logs in user
4. **Auto-redirect** → User taken to appropriate dashboard based on role

## ✅ Quality Assurance

### **Code Quality**
- Clean, readable code with proper comments
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Proper state management
- Responsive design implementation

### **Performance**
- Optimized re-renders with proper state management
- Efficient API calls with loading states
- Minimal bundle size impact

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

- Production-ready code with no console logs
- Proper error boundaries and fallbacks
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile-responsive design
